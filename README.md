Customer Lifetime Value Prediction With Machine Learning

This repository contains a machine learning project conducted for FunDrive Car Insurance to predict Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) in the context of car insurance. CLV is a crucial metric for understanding the value a customer brings to a business and helps in making decisions regarding customer retention, marketing efforts, and long-term business strategies.

## Business Problem:
FunDrive Insurance faces the challenge of predicting CLV accurately, as different factors contribute to determining CLV for car insurance clients. The company needs a machine learning tool to predict CLV and make informed decisions about customer retention strategies.

## Goals:
The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model to predict CLV with low error rates, helping FunDrive Insurance avoid losses from inefficient retention costs and target valuable clients more effectively.

## Data Understanding:
The dataset includes customer information and features related to CLV, with both numerical and categorical data. There are no missing values, but there are duplicates, which are dropped. Outliers are present, but they are not removed to preserve information. Income values of 0 are associated with unemployed clients.

## Attributes Information
- Vehicle Class: Type of vehicle insured by the customer.
- Coverage: Insurance coverage purchased by the customer.
- Renew Offer Type: Type of insurance policy renewal offer given to the customer when their insurance period expires.
- Employment Status: Customer's employment status.
- Marital Status: Customer's marital status.
- Education: Customer's education level.
- Number of Policies: The number of insurance policies owned by the customer.
- Monthly Premium Auto: The monthly premium amount paid by the customer for their automobile insurance policy.
- Total Claim Amount: The total amount claimed by the customer during their membership period.
- Income: Customer's income.
- Customer Lifetime Value: The target variable to be predicted. CLV measures how valuable a customer is from the perspective of potential revenue that can be generated by the company during the customer's membership.

## Data Preprocessing
- Data preprocessing involves preparing data for machine learning. In this case, two main steps are taken:
  - Scaling: This is like adjusting the scale of numerical values. We use a "robust scaler" because our data has many outliers. Scaling helps ensure that the differences in number magnitudes don't affect our analysis.
  - Encoding: This is the process of converting categorical data (like categories or labels) into numerical values. We use two types of encoding:
    - Ordinal encoder is used for data with an order or hierarchy, such as 'Coverage' and 'Education.'
    - One-hot encoder is used for data without a specific order, and when there are not too many unique values.

By performing these steps, the data becomes more suitable for machine learning models to work with.


## Modeling:
Several regression models, including Gradient Boosting with Transformed Target Regression, are benchmarked using RMSE, MAE, and MAPE as evaluation metrics. The best model is selected based on its performance, and it is used for CLV prediction.

## Hyperparameter Tuning:
Grid search is employed to optimize hyperparameters, improving the model's performance. The RMSE, MAE, and MAPE values are reduced, indicating better predictive accuracy.

## Conclusion:
The best model is the Gradient Boosting Regressor with Transformed Target Regression. The MAPE is approximately 10.22%, indicating a high level of accuracy for CLV prediction within the trained range.

## Recommendations:

Increase the dataset with CLV values above 18,000 for better predictions.
Add additional features such as contract duration, cross-selling, and demographic factors to improve model significance.
Conduct A/B testing to assess real-world model effectiveness.
Schedule periodic model updates to adapt to changing data and customer trends.
Consider building advanced models using deep learning and real-time integration into the company's systems.
Implement retention and upselling strategies based on CLV insights, such as cross-selling additional insurance products or encouraging existing customers to upgrade their coverage.
This repository provides the code, data preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation of the CLV prediction model for FunDrive Car Insurance.
